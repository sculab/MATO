# MATO: Measurement and Analysis TOol
Advancements in bioinformatics and genomics have heightened the significance of cytotaxonomy and morphology as fields of study. The quantification of various characters forms the basis of morphological investigations. However, due to variations among characters across different taxa, manual measurements are commonly employed. Yet, existing measurement tools for morphology and cytotaxonomy lack repeatability and statistical analysis compatibility. To address these limitations, we have developed MATO (Measurement and Analysis tools) as an updated version of the KaryoType software. MATO aims to accelerate repetitive morphometric tasks and yield quantitative and reproducible outcomes. By introducing size-based Karyotyping and a novel grouping algorithm, MATO enhances chromosome measurements and karyotype analysis. Additionally, MATO encompasses a broad range of morphometric characters, including length, size, angle, count, and color, frequently utilized in plant taxonomy. MATO empowers researchers in the fields of cytotaxonomy and morphology by providing enhanced measurement capabilities, statistical analysis compatibility, and improved user-friendliness, facilitating advancements in their research endeavors.
