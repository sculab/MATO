# MATO: A Measurement and Analysis TOol
The advances of the bioinformatics and genomics over recent years, and the growing importance of determining the relationships between structure and function, have made cytotaxonomy and morphology an increasingly important discipline. Quantitative determination of various traits is the basis for morphological studies. Due to diversity of traits in different taxa, many measurements must be performed manually. However, existing measurement tools for morphology and cytotaxonomy lack repeatability and not able to perform professional calculations and statistics. Here, we developed MATO (Measurement and Analysis tools), an update of previous software KaryoType, with the goal of accelerating repetitive morphometric tasks while also obtaining quantitative and reproducible results. MATO enhanced chromosome measurements and karyotype analysis from previous version by introducing size-based Karyotyping. . Additionally, MATO covers almost all the morphometric functions, including length, size, angle, count and color, for plant taxonomy.
